title: 6. Open data and your research report
subtitle: Written by Rob Davies
order: 7
---

Week 6 focuses on the research report.

Our time in class will involve exploring and discussing:

- locating, accessing, checking open data;

- discussing analysis options or plans

We do not look at new analysis methods or code so there are _no_ new practical materials.

Before class: take a look at the video lectures (in 3 parts) in which I explain the reasons why we do the research report, and why you can expect to benefit from the exercise.

  - [Part 1](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/panopto/view.php?id=2012832)
  - [Part 2](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/panopto/view.php?id=2012837)
  - [Part 3](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/panopto/view.php?id=2012838)
  - [Slides here - html version](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=2012803)
  

Optionally: you can read a book chapter Introduction: why? we wrote to explain in-depth our thinking behind the exercise -- this may interest those with an interest in doing research, open science, and the motivation for the good practice we advise.

-- You do not need to read this but we hope it presents a deeper understanding for why the exercise is useful, and why we teach and work with open science practices.

Optionally: [we wrote a book chapter How?]() to describe different ways -- step-by-step -- that you can choose to do the research report. This information is not instruction, it is advice and I am happy to discuss these suggestions.

Pop into the drop in (optional). Please note this is in Levy Lab - do come along with any questions at all on the workbooks so far.

Assignment 3
By the end of Week 6, please submit your Assignment 3. Assignment 3 is a little different than the previous assignments. This one provides you with a data set for you to explore, and provide the R script that you used to explore the data, together with a brief report of what you tested in the data set, why, and what you found. You will need the Assignment 3 data set, and more instructions are in Assignment 3.
