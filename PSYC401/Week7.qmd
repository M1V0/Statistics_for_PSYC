title: Is it morning or day?

# POC

This is a proof of concept that we can hide/autoshow information. It is a bit clunky and requires some javascript functions, but theoretically only requires updating once a year and then a simple copy-paste of information. 

## This is hidden content based on hours

```{=html}
<div class='open_wk1'>Success! It is morning!</div>
<div class='closed_wk1'>This is hidden!</div>
<br/>
```

## The below is only available between different hours

```{=html}
<div class='open_wk2'>Success! It is afternoon!</div>
<div class='closed_wk2'>This is hidden!</div>
```
