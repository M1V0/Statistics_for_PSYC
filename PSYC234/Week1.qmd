# Lab

## What happens

1. In each lab:
+ Model output, or model plot with dataset
+ In small groups, work backwards to *plan* the analysis script that produced the model output
  + Use lab time/staff to check plan

2. Independently of the lab:
+ Generate the script as a group
  + Help each other
  + Scrape code from all your statistics modules
    + The internet
    + R books

3. Submit for feedback
+ Submit as group
+ Random sample of scripts will get feedback
+ No credit here â€“ learning process as preparation for your own project!
